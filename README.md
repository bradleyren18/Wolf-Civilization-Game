#Wolf game (v1.0)

****Rules: ****

###You are controlling a wolf pack, which needs 500 territory to win. You start with 1 territory.
###The wolves need meat and bone to survive, which is provided by hunters. They produce 4 meat and 2 bone per day and cost 20 meat and 10 bone to buy. Each wolf consumes 2 meat and 1 bone per day.
###To gain territory, you need scouts, which cost 20 meat and 10 bone. They havea a 50% chance of conquering 1 new territory per day, though this increases as you get weapons.
###To get weapons, which help the scouts, you need wood, stone and bone. Lumberjacks (which cost 10 meat and 5 bone) produce 2 wood per day. Miners (which also cost 10 meat and 5 bone) produce 2 stone per day.
###There are also helpers, which do all of the jobs above for only 30 meat and 15 bone! A great type of wolf!

###There are also events, such as losing meat/territory or gaining it. These events are distributed randomly throughout the game. To keep track of everything, you have the Log and Latest Event at the bottom.

##Win conditions:

###You get 500 territory

##Lose conditions:
###You run out of meat, or can't produce any more.

#Have fun!
